My experiences thus far have strengthened my passion and proficiency in programming and allowed me to explore hardware for the first time with hands-on experience. Outside of academia, I indulge in puzzle-solving as a member of Puzzlehunt, build buggies for CIA Buggy, and waltz across the dance floor in Ballroom Dance Club."

Our goal at the Chapman lab was to produce potential compounds to inhibit the transcription factor NRF2 to increase the effects of chemotherapy. I implemented purification techniques such as thin layer chromatography and column chromatography to create such compounds that would be potent enough to inhibit NRF2 on a large scale. I won 3rd place in Biochemistry at the Southern Arizona Research, Science, and Engineering Foundation competition and am a co-author of an American Chemical Society paper."
